# elmclient

This is a "single page application" that acts as a client
for our REST API. We expect it will be the primary way in
which students will interact with the class API. 

This code was forked from the [elm-webpack-starter](https://github.com/elm-community/elm-webpack-starter). Below,
is the original README from that project.

But first, some useful links from Kyle for Jacob

* [https://medium.com/@zenitram.oiram/a-beginners-guide-to-making-a-single-page-app-in-elm-d1a89d3845fa](A Beginnerâ€™s Guide to making a Single Page app in Elm)
* [http://madole.github.io/blog/2015/08/26/setting-up-webpack-dev-middleware-in-your-express-application/](Setting Up Webpack Dev Middleware in Express) (a bit dated)

Note to self: we need to make this run differently in production---we shouldn't be using webpack-dev-server.


### About:
A simple Webpack setup for writing [Elm](http://elm-lang.org/) apps:

* Dev server with live reloading, HMR
* Support for CSS/SCSS (with Autoprefixer), image assets
* Bootstrap 3.3+ (Sass version)
* Bundling and minification for deployment
* Basic app scaffold, using `Html.beginnerProgram`
* A snippet of example code to get you started!


### Install:
Clone this repo into a new project folder, e.g. `my-elm-project`:
```
git clone https://github.com/moarwick/elm-webpack-starter my-elm-project
cd my-elm-project
```

Re-initialize the project folder as your own repo:
```
rm -rf .git         # on Windows: rmdir .git /s /q
git init
git add .
git commit -m 'first commit'
```

Install all dependencies using the handy `reinstall` script:
```
npm run reinstall
```
*This does a clean (re)install of all npm and elm packages, plus a global elm install.*


### Serve locally:
```
npm start
```
* Access app at `http://localhost:8080/`
* Get coding! The entry point file is `src/elm/Main.elm`
* Browser will refresh automatically on any file changes..


### Build & bundle for prod:
```
npm run build
```

* Files are saved into the `/dist` folder
* To check it, open `dist/index.html`
